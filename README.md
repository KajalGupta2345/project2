# git remote add origin 
remote - jha pr code ko push krna chah rhe.
a remote origin refers to the remote repository where your local repository's code will be hosted. This remote repository could be on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or a private server. Adding a remote origin establishes a connection between your local repository and the remote repository, enabling the exchange of code changes.

# git remote -v
The git remote -v command is used to display the URLs that Git uses to fetch and push updates to a remote repository.

# git push -u origin main
git push -u origin main, you are pushing your local changes to the remote repository's main branch and setting the upstream branch for the current branch.

# WorkFlow 
Github:- code changes -> Github
Local Git:- code changes -> add -> commit -> push

# Git Branches 
a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.

# Merging Code

git diff <-branch name-> to compare commits,branches
git merge <-branch name-> to merge 2 branches

# pull request

A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another branch in a Git repository. Typically, pull requests are used in collaborative workflows where multiple developers work on different features or fixes in separate branches. A pull request allows the team to review and discuss the proposed changes before they are merged into the main branch.

# pull command 
Git pull is a command which is used to fetch and integrate the changes which are present in the remote repository to the local repository.

# merge conflicts 
A merge conflict happens when Git is unable to automatically reconcile differences in code between two commits. This typically occurs during a merge operation, where changes from different branches are combined.

# Fixing Mistakes

git reset -> Git reset is a powerful command used to undo changes in your working directory and staging area.

git reset HEAD~1 -> The HEAD~1 argument specifies the commit to which you want to reset.
