# git remote add origin 
remote - jha pr code ko push krna chah rhe.
a remote origin refers to the remote repository where your local repository's code will be hosted. This remote repository could be on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or a private server. Adding a remote origin establishes a connection between your local repository and the remote repository, enabling the exchange of code changes.

# git remote -v
The git remote -v command is used to display the URLs that Git uses to fetch and push updates to a remote repository.

# git push -u origin main
git push -u origin main, you are pushing your local changes to the remote repository's main branch and setting the upstream branch for the current branch.

# WorkFlow 

Github:- code changes -> Github
Local Git:- code changes -> add -> commit -> push
